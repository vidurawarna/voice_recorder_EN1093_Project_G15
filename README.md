# voice_recorder_EN1093_Project_G15
Simple Voice Recorder is a simple tool to record multiple voice tracks and then play them back. The purpose of this project is to create a Simple Voice Recorder using theories of signal processing and information theory. The main objectives of this project are to record and save multiple voice recordings, selectively playback the recordings, and do minor adjustments to their spectrum during playback. Signal processing like frequency scaling and signal enhancement with low pass, band pass, and high pass filtering is carried out by using  MATLAB as a testing tool. (Relevant MATLAB codes can be found in the report.) An ATmega 328p chip was programmed with AVR. In this project, 8bit PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) is used for ADC ( Analog to Digital Conversion) and Fast PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is used for DAC ( Digital to Analog Conversion).
